  // Here we are using the PROMPT function to get user input
  // and then assign that user input to some variables.
  //
  // THINK ABOUT IT: If we're prompting a user for input,
  // what TYPE of DATA might we be expecting?
  let firstname = prompt("Your firstname");
  let lastname = prompt("your lastname");
  let place = prompt("your place");
  // `document.body` allows us to access the BODY element on our page!
  // `document.body.innerHTML` allows us to peek at the HTML contained
  // within our BODY element.
  //
  // We can change the contents of BODY element by assigning to
  // `document.body.innerHTML`.
  //
  // And, using the "addition assignment operator," we can CONCATENATE
  // a new HTML string to the end of innerHTML, in order to show new
  // content on the screen.
  document.body.innerHTML += "Here is a story for you!<br>";
  
  // JavaScript usually doesn't care how much whitespace we add between
  // things. So, we could space things out like this, if it makes our code
  // easier to read than (for example), one really long line.
  //
  // Notice that the following will work. Can you predict what it will do?
  document.body.innerHTML +=
    "The inconsiderate " +
    firstname +
    " strode proudly through " +
    lastname +
    ", dropping " +
    place +
    " everywhere.";
  // Try creating a new variable using a `let` statement,
  // and assign to that new variable some user input, using the `prompt()`
  // function you see us using at the top of this script.
  // 
  // Try experimenting with reassigning the BODY element's innerHTML,
  // and see how it works.
